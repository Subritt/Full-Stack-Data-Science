    "### 5. What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is the process of recording events that occur during program execution. In Python, the `logging` module provides a way to log messages from your code to various destinations, such as the console, a file, or a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is important in software development for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Debugging**: Logging can be used to help diagnose and fix errors in the code by providing information about what happened leading up to the error. This can be especially useful when errors occur in production environments where debugger is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monitoring**: Logging can be used to monitor the performance and behavior of the application in real-time. By logging key events and metrics, one can gain insights into how the code is performing and identify potential issues before they become critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Auditing**: Logging can be used to track user actions and system events for auditing purposes. This can be important for compliance and security reasons, as it allows to trace who did what and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**: Logging can be used to document the behavior of the code over time. Logging key events and changes gives a historical record of how the code has evolved and why certain decisions were made."

    "### 6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when each log level would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python logging, log levels are used to indicate the severity of a log message. There are several log levels available, each with a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the most commonly used log levels and when each level would be appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DEBUG: The DEBUG log level is used for detailed diagnostic information. This level is typically only used during development or debugging, as it can generate a lot of output and may not be useful in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage: Logging variable values or function calls for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. INFO: The INFO log level is used to provide general information about the application's state or progress. This level is useful for tracking the overall progress of the application and providing status updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage: Logging when an application starts or stops, or when a user logs in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. WARNING: The WARNING log level is used to indicate a potential problem or issue that may need attention. This level is useful for highlighting potential issues before they become errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage: Logging when a resource is running low, or when an application is using deprecated functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ERROR: The ERROR log level is used to indicate an error or exception that has occurred in the application. This level is useful for identifying and diagnosing errors in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage: Logging when an application encounters an unexpected input or fails to connect to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. CRITICAL: The CRITICAL log level is used to indicate a critical failure that may cause the application to stop functioning entirely. This level is useful for identifying and responding to critical failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage: Logging when an application runs out of memory or when a critical dependency fails to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Python logging, it's important to choose the appropriate log level for each message to ensure that the logs are useful and informative without being overwhelming. By using the appropriate log levels, developers can more easily identify and diagnose issues in their applications."

    "### 7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you costumise the log message format using formatters?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python's logging module, log formatters are used to specify the format of log messages. A log formatter is a class that defines how log records should be formatted before they are output to a log file, console, or other logging destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the logging module uses a basic formatter that includes the log level, the name of the logger that generated the message, and the message itself. However, you can customize the log message format using formatters to include additional information such as timestamps, process IDs, thread IDs, and more."

    "   ```\n",
